# Vote Contract

The Voting Contract project introduces a straightforward smart contract designed to track votes on-chain. Each address will be voted for once.

## Goals of the Project (My First Solidity Project)

The primary goal of the Vote Contract project is to:

- **Implement a Basic Voting Mechanism:** Showcase the simplest form of a voting mechanism, providing an opportunity to experiment with voting structures for the first time.

## Technicalities of the Project

- **Usage of Internal Functions:** The project employs internal functions, checking how that works for the first time.

**Note:** The Vote Contract project serves as an educational venture into understanding and implementing basic voting mechanisms.
